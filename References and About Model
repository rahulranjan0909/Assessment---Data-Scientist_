This repository contains three diffrent model for Document classificatation 
although the models can be hypertuned to a great extent using GPU but for the
case i have tried to keep it simple.The logic behind every model is to use classification approach the converting the image dataset inn arrays and target label encoded frpm 0 to 9.
